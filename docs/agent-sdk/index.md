# OpenAI Agent SDK Documentation

## Introduction

This documentation covers the OpenAI-Powered Agent SDK for the Flip Card Project (v1.0). The SDK provides a practical, maintainable implementation approach using OpenAI's APIs to enhance applications with intelligent agents.

The SDK uses a lightweight "managed runner" architecture that provides several key advantages:

1. **Simplified Maintenance**: Centralizes configuration and reduces boilerplate
2. **Modular Implementation**: Enables easy swapping of underlying agent technology
3. **Flexible Deployment**: Supports both client-side and server-side execution
4. **Minimal Dependencies**: Reduces version conflicts and update requirements

## ⚠️ Important Notice: Dual Documentation System

This documentation exists in two formats:

1. **Standard Markdown (.md files)**
   - What you're reading now
   - Basic documentation viewable directly on GitHub
   - Essential for basic documentation readers

2. **Interactive MDX (.mdx files)**
   - Enhanced versions with live examples
   - Located alongside .md files with .mdx extension
   - Requires local setup (see README.md)
   - Powers the interactive documentation site

### For Documentation Contributors

When making changes:
- If you're modifying content, update **both** .md and .mdx versions
- Keep content synchronized between versions
- Only modify interactive components in .mdx files
- See README.md for local development setup

For interactive documentation setup and development, see [README.md](./README.md).

## Getting Started

If you're new to the Agent SDK, we recommend starting with the [Overview](./overview.md) to understand the basic concepts and architecture. Then, proceed to the [Integration Guide](./integration-guide.md) for practical implementation steps.

For specific implementation details:
1. Review the [Architecture Guide](./architecture.md) for deep technical understanding
2. Explore [Implementation Options](./implementation-options.md) for different approaches
3. Check the examples directory for concrete implementation patterns
