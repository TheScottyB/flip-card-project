# Interactive Agent SDK Documentation 

We've created a next-generation documentation experience for the Agent SDK, featuring interactive components that allow users to experiment with the SDK directly within the documentation.

## Key Features

### 1. Interactive Demo Components

The documentation includes live, interactive components that allow users to:

- Configure agent settings in real-time
- Modify sample data and see the results
- Experiment with different prompts
- View simulated agent execution and results
- See code updates based on their configuration changes

### 2. Modular Architecture

The documentation is structured into logical sections:

- **Overview**: Introduction to the Agent SDK and its benefits
- **OpenAI Implementation**: Detailed example using OpenAI's APIs
- **Alternative Implementations**: Examples using Anthropic, local rule-based, and hybrid approaches

### 3. Implementation Examples

Each implementation includes:

- Live, interactive demos
- Code samples with syntax highlighting
- Configuration options and examples
- Comparison of different approaches

### 4. Visual Learning Aids

- Architectural diagrams
- Visual representation of fallback chains
- Comparison tables for different implementation options

## Technologies Used

- **React**: For interactive components
- **Next.js**: Framework for the documentation site
- **MDX**: Markdown with JSX for embedding components in documentation
- **CSS-in-JSX**: For component styling

## How It Works

The core of the interactive documentation is the `AgentDemo` component, which provides a simulated agent environment. Users can:

1. Configure the agent through a tabbed interface
2. Input prompts and sample data
3. Run the agent and see the results in real-time
4. View and edit the code that would implement these features

The component includes simulation logic that provides realistic feedback without requiring actual API calls, making it perfect for learning and experimentation.

## Running the Documentation

To run the interactive documentation:

1. Navigate to the docs/agent-sdk directory
2. Run the script: `./run-demo.sh`
3. Open your browser to http://localhost:3000

## Why This Approach Is Valuable

Traditional documentation forces users to context-switch between reading docs and trying code in their environment. Our interactive approach:

- **Accelerates learning** by providing immediate feedback
- **Encourages experimentation** by making it safe and easy to try different configurations
- **Demonstrates model-agnostic flexibility** by showing multiple implementations
- **Provides visual understanding** of complex patterns like fallback chains

## Next Steps

This proof-of-concept can be extended to:

1. Add more examples (Gemini, Mistral, Llama, etc.)
2. Implement actual API integrations (with user-provided keys)
3. Add code generation features for creating boilerplate
4. Create a shareable playground where configurations can be saved and shared
