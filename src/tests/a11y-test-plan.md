- Puppeteer for browser automation

## Manual Testing Checklist
- [ ] Test with keyboard only (no mouse)
- [ ] Test with screen reader in each browser
- [ ] Test with page zoomed to 200%
- [ ] Test with high contrast mode
- [ ] Test with prefers-reduced-motion enabled

## Reporting Issues
All accessibility issues should be documented with:
- Description of the issue
- Steps to reproduce
- Expected accessible behavior
- WCAG success criterion that is violated
- Screenshot or video recording
